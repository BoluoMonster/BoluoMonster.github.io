I am currently a PhD student at Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU), focusing on advancing the field of autonomous driving. My research aims to address the critical issue of uncertainty in autonomous driving. By integrating learning and planning methods, I strive to develop robust solutions that enhance the safety and efficiency of autonomous systems.

## Research Interests
- Autonomous Driving: Exploring advanced techniques to improve the decision-making capabilities of autonomous vehicles.
- Uncertainty Management: Developing methods to model and mitigate uncertainties in complex and dynamic environments.
- Behavior Planning: Designing algorithms that enable autonomous vehicles to make safe and effective driving decisions.
- Trajectory Planning: Creating precise and reliable paths for autonomous vehicles to follow in real time.

## Current Work
My current work is designing a hierarchical behavior and trajectory planning system that enables the ego vehicle to implement efficient and safe plans on complex urban roads.

Goals and Vision
My goal is to contribute to the advancement of autonomous driving technologies, making them safer, more reliable, and widely accessible. I envision a future where autonomous vehicles seamlessly integrate into our daily lives, significantly reducing traffic accidents and improving overall transportation efficiency.
